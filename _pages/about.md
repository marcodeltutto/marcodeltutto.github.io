I'm Marco Del Tutto, an Associate Scientist/<a href="https://www.fnal.gov/pub/forphysicists/fellowships/robert_wilson/">Wilson Fellow</a> at Fermilab. Before that, I was a Research Associate/<a href="https://www.fnal.gov/pub/forphysicists/fellowships/leon_lederman/index.html">Lederman Fellow</a> at Fermilab, and prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University. I earned my PhD in Physics at the University of Oxford in 2019.

My research is focused on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino">Neutrino Physics</a>, and I am currently involved in the SBND and MicroBooNE collaborations. I tend to be a multifaceted physicist working on data analysis, machine learning, simulation, and hardware related to Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPC) detectors. Additionally, I am leading an R&D effort to build a magnetized LArTPC detector in a test beam.
